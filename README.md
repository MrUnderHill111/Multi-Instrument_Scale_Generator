8/24/25 *note- I will slowly continue to add more instruments, scales, and overall fuctionality. Please feel free to request anything specific.

A lightweight web-app that uses simple dropdown boxes to generate images of musical scales across a range of instruments and keys. This tool uses SVG image generation instead of relying on assets, enabling full functionality when downloaded for local desktop use.

Instructions:

1. Select your desired Key and number of instruments at the top.
2. Use the dropdown boxes at the individual instrument level to choose a specific instrument and to further customize your key preferences.
3. Practice and have fun! 

V3 release -8/24/25

- Added additional functionality for individual key changes at the instrument level.
